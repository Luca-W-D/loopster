# Loopster

## Demo now live at [https://loopster.l-uca.com](loopster.l-uca.com)!

Loopster is an open-source, self-hosted tool that allows for users to upload their downloaded Spotify history and create playlists.

The project is based on the idea that people will automatically filter through songs they like through skipping. Therefore, the tool will look at groups of songs that were played *without* being skipped. These songs should be similar to eachother + enjoyable to the end user.

There is additionally functionality to import songs from a user's library or from Spotify search results. All playlists can be automatically uploaded directly to a user's account.
